# Livepeer Exporter

![image](https://github.com/rickstaa/livepeer-exporter/assets/17570430/d168d3fc-4e58-4424-9836-d04e425d2991)

Livepeer Exporter is a lightweight tool designed to enhance the monitoring capabilities of [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org/). As a Prometheus exporter, it fetches [various metrics](#metrics) from different Livepeer endpoints and exposes them via an HTTP server, ready for Prometheus to scrape. This tool is the perfect companion to the [Livepeer monitoring service](https://docs.livepeer.org/orchestrators/guides/monitor-metrics), extending the range of Livepeer metrics that can be monitored. By providing deeper insights into Livepeer's performance, Livepeer Exporter helps users optimize their streaming workflows and ensure reliable service delivery.

## Configuration

Before using the Livepeer Exporter, you must configure it using environment variables. These variables allow you to customize the behaviour of the exporter to suit your specific needs. Below, you'll find a list of all the environment variables you can set, a description of what they do, and their default values if they are not specified.

### Required environment variables

- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_ORCHESTRATOR_ADDRESS`: The address of the orchestrator to fetch data from.

### Optional environment variables

- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_ORCHESTRATOR_ADDRESS_SECONDARY`: The address of the secondary orchestrator to fetch data from. Used to calculate the 'livepeer_orch_stake' metric. When set, the LPT stake of this address is added to the LPT stake that the orchestrator bonds.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_INFO_FETCH_INTERVAL`: How often to fetch general orchestrator information. Defaults to `1m`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_SCORE_FETCH_INTERVAL`: How often to fetch score data for the orchestrator. Defaults to `1m`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_DELEGATORS_FETCH_INTERVAL`: How often to fetch delegators data for the orchestrator. Defaults to `5m`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_TEST_STREAMS_FETCH_INTERVAL`:How often to fetch the test streams data for the orchestrator. Defaults to `1h`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_TICKETS_FETCH_INTERVAL`: How often to fetch ticket data for the orchestrator. Defaults to `1h`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_REWARDS_FETCH_INTERVAL`: How often to fetch rewards data for the orchestrator. Defaults to `12h`.
- `CRYPTO_PRICES_EXPORTER_FETCH_INTERVAL`: How often to fetch the crypto prices. Defaults to `1m`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_INFO_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to update the orchestrator info metrics.  Defaults to `30s`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_SCORE_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to update the orchestrator score metrics. Defaults to `30s`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_DELEGATORS_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to update the orchestrator delegators metrics.  Defaults to `30s`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_TEST_STREAMS_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to update the orchestrator test streams metrics.  Defaults to `30s`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_TICKETS_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to update the orchestrator tickets metrics. Defaults to `30s`.
- `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_REWARDS_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to update the orchestrator rewards metrics.  Defaults to `30s`.
- `CRYPTO_PRICES_EXPORTER_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: How often to update the crypto prices metrics. Defaults to `30s`.

All intervals are specified as a string representation of a duration, e.g., "5m" for 5 minutes, "2h" for 2 hours, etc. See [time#ParseDuration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) for format details.

> [!NOTE]\
> The `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_TEST_STREAMS_FETCH_INTERVAL`, `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_TICKETS_FETCH_INTERVAL`, and `LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_REWARDS_FETCH_INTERVAL`environment variables have higher default values. This adjustment is made considering the nature of the endpoints they fetchâ€”they might be slow or return a substantial amount of data. By setting these values to a higher interval, you can effectively reduce the load on the exporter, ensuring optimal performance.

## Usage

This section explains how to run the Livepeer Exporter. You can run it locally on your own machine, or use Docker for easy setup and teardown.

### Run exporter locally

Running the exporter locally allows you to quickly start and stop it as needed. To do this, you'll need to set the necessary environment variables and then start the exporter. Replace `your-orchestrator-address`, with your own values:

```bash
export LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_ORCHESTRATOR_ADDRESS=your-orchestrator-address
go run main.go
```

The exporter will be available on port `9153`. Additional [configuration](#configuration) environment variables can be passed to the exporter by adding them to the command above.

### Running the Exporter with Docker

You can run the exporter using the Docker image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rickstaa/livepeer-exporter). To pull and run the exporter from Docker Hub, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --name livepeer-exporter \
    -e "LIVEPEER_EXPORTER_ORCHESTRATOR_ADDRESS=<your-orchestrator-address>" \
    -p 9153:9153 \
    rickstaa/livepeer-exporter:latest
```

Replace `<your-orchestrator-address>` with the address of your orchestrator. This command will start the exporter and expose the metrics on port `9153` for Prometheus to scrape. This command will start the exporter and expose the metrics on port `9153` for Prometheus to scrape. Additional environment variables can be passed to the exporter by adding them to the command above.

> [!NOTE]\
>  This repository also contains a [DockerFile](./Dockerfile) and [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file. These files can be used to build and run the exporter locally. To do this, clone this repository and run `docker compose up` in the repository's root directory.

### Configure Prometheus

For Prometheus to scrape the exporter, add the following to your `prometheus.yml`:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: livepeer-exporter
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:9153"]
```

This configuration tells Prometheus to scrape metrics from the Livepeer Exporter running on localhost port `9153`.
